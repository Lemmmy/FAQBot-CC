There currently exist a few fairly well-known servers that adopt ComputerCraft as their main feature.
While a lot of popular modpacks include CC, they may not prioritise it and therefore include less support for it.

Known servers that are currently running and focused at computer mods:
- [SwitchCraft 3](https://sc3.io) - A multiplayer economy-survival server started in 2022.
